  <p>Committing an act of vandalism, as inspired by Daniel Dennett's <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/problem-counterfeit-people/674075/">article in The Atlantic</a>. I wanted to see how easy it is to spin up a troll twitter bot, using the twitter dev API and a hosted Llama2-7B model. In this case we take on the persona of Ian McEwan's pet cocker spaniel. Part educational, part amusing, part degrading trust in society's institutions.</p>
  <p>Source code <a href="https://github.com/evangriffiths/scruffy-tweets">here</a>. Below is the resulting twitter feed. New content daily:</p>
